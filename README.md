# treasureislandforbinders
_Treasure Island_ for the DIY bookbinder, featuring 4 color and over 100 black and white drawings (including custom dropcaps) created by Louis Rhead for the 1915 edition. Available in US letter and A4 format. Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States. Fonts used, to the best of my knowledge, are free to use for any purpose including commercial. Whatever original work of mine this effort represents, I place into the public domain. In other words, to the best of my knowledge you _may_ make and sell copies of this. I am not a lawyer and you are responsible for compliance with your government's copyright law(s).

CW: Ableism, colorism. Use of "Negress" to refer to a Black woman and "half-breed" to refer to people with Indigenous ancestry. Death of a parent. Description of end-stage alcoholism. Description of 18th-century medical practices including bloodletting. Casual violence and death of minor characters. Abandonment ("marooning") of characters.

_**I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing**._ If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).

If you are using US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), download the "letter" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4, download the "a4" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
